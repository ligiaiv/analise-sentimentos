this is in the damage aspect of it and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the	had been in there and if the remains of the almost full term baby boy were inside the female s remains at the time of death also the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons

they believe police say that is where scott peterson told them that he did go fishing the day that laci peterson did disappear now a source close to the investigation has told me that what they are really looking for are concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of laci peterson s	or clothing or something attached to it that they did discover a concrete weight in scott peterson s warehouse if it matched that would be something that could link scott peterson it would be like a smoking gun in this case

dr dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986 then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if impaired turns healthy colon	cancerous soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers
but there was no way to prove dr knudson s two hit theory back then scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the	that contain the genes occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible
then a scientific team led by molecular geneticist webster cavenee then at the university of utah found the answer the team used a battery of the newly developed gene probes snippets of genetic material that can track a gene s presence in a	by analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome

it was an audacious claim but in baltimore dr vogelstein a young molecular biologist at johns hopkins medical school believed dr knudson was right and set out to repeat the cavenee experiment in	from other cancers his was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called wilm s tumor

it was the confirming evidence we all needed that lcb gene rcb losses were critical to the development of a common tumor says ray white at howard hughes medical institute in salt lake city but dr vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that if damaged flipped a colon	into full blown malignancy they focused on chromosome 17
they focused on chromosome 17 for months the johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor	such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene
when they found it last winter dr vogelstein was dubious that the search was over his doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a princeton university researcher arnold levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal	into cancerous ones the deletion dr vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
but mr levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth whereas the johns hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth despite that when the johns hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer	with the mr levine s p53 gene they found the two were identical it turned out that in mr levine s cancer studies he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 a cancer suppressing gene the discovery suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation says robert weinberg a leader in cancer gene research at whitehead institute in cambridge mass
the p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer in a report out last week john minna and colleagues at the national cancer institute say that about half the	taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene there also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers

future prospects also seem infinite for microarray	which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments jerry huang notes that dna chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology on one little biochip tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes
in other words whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually today using biochips they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once in particular biochips not only can speed the pace of research but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the	thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick but also more humane
dr konan peck an assistant research fellow at academia sinica s institute of biomedical sciences lrb ibms rrb says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool with this in mind peck has developed nylon based biochips which have been called the poor man s biochip since they cost a third less than glass	apart from the material itself being cheaper the nylon chips use a visiblespectrum colorimetric system to display results so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner which costs 50 70 less than using a special laser detector

many scholars used to steer clear of taiwan s colonial history but teng happened to take an interest in the subject just as taiwanese society was beginning to become more liberal the fact that teng was not a member of the academic	was also fortunate for it freed him of the pressures that academics must deal with says teng this was about the story of my hometown
for example in an academia sinica study that ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between taiwan s nine main aboriginal tribes teng helped to study the thao and the pazeh lrb a plains dwelling tribe rrb according to hsu muchu a researcher at academia sinica s institute of ethnology teng hsiangyang s status as a member of the medical	and his wide contacts among the aborigines enabled him to make a key contribution to the research project if it had nt been for teng s detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans the researchers would never have been able in some cases to identify pure tribal lineages for study

i have to hurry up and get the book written teng had been planning to pass the torch to others both in	affairs and in his efforts to collect the oral histories of the aborigines i ve done my bit said teng and soon it will be time to let the aborigines speak for themselves
then the earthquake threw a wrench in teng s plans after his medical laboratory was destroyed teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local	he has kept himself busy preparing posters organizing a community newspaper and establishing the new puli community development foundation
after his medical laboratory was destroyed teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local	he has kept himself busy preparing posters organizing a community newspaper and establishing the new puli community development foundation says teng puli wo nt let me go

analysts predict a 35 rise in the deflator after climbing 46 in the second quarter they note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the us trade	in august was reported earlier this month hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the us economy was losing its momentum a 190 point plunge in us stock shares compounded the view they say

china could exhaust its foreign exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance of payments deficit according to the report completed last month if china s trade	continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports

japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of 182 billion for the first 10 days of october down from 316 billion a year earlier the finance ministry said the latest drop shows the narrowing in the nation s trade	reflected in successive full monthly reports is continuing the report follows five consecutive declines in full monthly figures
forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the 2 billion lrb 32 billion rrb deficit in the current account reported for august the august deficit and the 22 billion	registered in july are topped only by the 23 billion deficit of october 1988 sanjay joshi european economist at baring brothers co said there is no sign that britain s manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports
combined with at least some rebound in exports after august s unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as 13 billion mr briscoe who also forecasts a 13 billion current account	warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo nt advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions nevertheless he noted no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound
polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for mr courter unless he closes the	republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month going into the 1990s the gop is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment democrats in the past
jack kemp and the writers irving kristol and george gilder were influences and mr courter s own conservative credentials proved useful to the current new jersey gop governor thomas kean in the 1981 republican primary here the same partnership is now crucial to mr courter s fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the	between his record and that of the more moderate prochoice gov kean while the warren county congressman pursued an antigovernment antitax agenda in washington gov kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of new jersey s budget in his eight years in office

a widening of the deficit if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar would exacerbate trade problems but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted in any event mr englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade	have already been made trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said

the conference was entitled economic mechanisms for environmental protection a significant departure from east bloc usage which recognizes only one economic mechanism central planning to direct industrial behavior even more remarkably it focused on emissions trading and similar	approaches to address pollution notwithstanding poland s lack of functioning markets why did east bloc participants unanimously endorse market based pollution approaches
conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from lrb a rrb marxist devaluation of environmental resources which are not produced by labor lrb b rrb planned economies inability to control pollution where enterprises are state owned and penalties are paid by the government and lrb c rrb the continuing stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the west they repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership genuine competition based on	factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions the solutions they formally proposed included lead sulfur taxes conservation and recycling incentives reforestation offsets transferable pollution permits an ecological bank to finance pollution reduction credits and debt for environment swaps
and the poles are engaged in commerce but the implications of such a shift to	approaches go well beyond the fact that poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year those implications include privatization

now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is nt insured under federal deposit insurance the tip off came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd s estimated current	value had plummeted by 9000 in a month several phone calls and a visit to his broker s office later the dentist found out that the 9000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the cd and that the amount was nt insured

to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms it must also evaluate the real estate	in the chosen location from a new perspective specifically it must understand how real estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities

when a regional economy catches cold the local real estate	gets pneumonia in other words real estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid1970s in new york
but the reverse is also true when a region s economy rebounds from a slowdown these real estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy why do local real estate	overreact to regional economic cycles because real estate purchases and leases are such major long term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth

to some observers the empty office buildings of houston s see through skyline were indicative of a very troubled economy as usual the real estate	had overreacted actually the region s economy retained a firm foundation
and personal income after slumping in the mid1980s has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms today metropolitan houston s real estate	is poised for a significant turnaround more than 42000 jobs were added in metro houston last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry
and forecasts project a 25 to 3 growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real estate	has overreacted to the region s economic trends although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston by some measures metropolitan denver s economy has actually improved in the past four years
the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy in a self fulfilling prophecy therefore the region s real estate	all but collapsed in recent years housing building permits are down more than 75 from their 1983 peaks

1 rrb voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest 2 rrb congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in	dealing with national issues lrb programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and or confers benefits on the population at large rrb and attending to local issues lrb constituency service and pork barrel rrb 3 rrb republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit seeking than are democratic members of congress

fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in	finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house

and now because of the trend in society of reviving taiwanese as the mother tongue taiwanese drama has been able to leap into prime time to become the mainstream offering in the past few years the 800 pm time slot has long been the flagship and leading money maker for	stations for a program to get into this slot besides being commercially viable in the past it also had to be politically correct
because the government wanted to promote mandarin taiwanese was officially seen as a rustic dialect and was never eligible for prime time the three government run	stations of that era china television lrb ctv rrb chinese television service lrb cts rrb and taiwan television lrb ttv rrb had a tacit agreement that they would only show taiwanese programs at noon or in the 630 pm time slot when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people the programming for these time slots was lowbudget and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in taiwan s unsophisticated rural past mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters in law and the like or family comedies
for one thing stereotypes remained strong and love still retained many of the old traditions being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after moving into the husband s home moreover because of opposition from high officials at the	network after several episodes the performers who had previously spoken in taiwanese had their dialogue changed to mandarin with a taiwanese accent however because the plot was realistic ratings were unprecedented and love even defeated widow s watch based on a novel by and also produced by the vastly popular romance writer chiung yao and broadcast on ctv
the government around that time adopted a policy of allowing producers to go to mainland china to film and there was a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed against a mainland backdrop still	stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for nativist taiwanese drama after the qingdao lake incident in 1994 mainland fever plummeted and nativist stories using the taiwanese language once again saw their star rising

lin adds that intellectuals criticize such shows but in fact do nt watch tv	stations have always based their decisions on ratings and it is virtually impossible to expect that they will change a proven formula rather than say that serials are a mirror of life it would be better to say that people identify with the characters in these dramas even if their own lives are not as dramatic

by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men the nationstate maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders outside those limits it	as against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against the inferior peoples of the nonwestern world a position of dominance it became the sole subject of international law lrb a term which it is pertinent to remember was coined by bentham rrb a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena
the rule of law historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare recognizing that the rule of law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society the congress	that it also included the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the nonsoviet world
reference to two other concepts nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contours of the new principle in its beginnings the nationstate had to struggle to	itself internally against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism
all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality john adams	in the continental congress declaration of rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters the british constitution and the common law and jefferson appealed in the declaration of independence to the tribunal of the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of nature and of nature s god they fought hard but they were forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783
many believe and understandably that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede but though each of its members had	this right against the union the final constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11 nearly a month before hostilities began included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution
one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought but though the southern states when drafting a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to	the right to secede the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states if the union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union

by 1987 thenspeaker jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii if a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and	a power of excision declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable the constitution does not expressly give the president such power
one could argue that it is not an	of a item veto at all for the president by exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers there is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills if congress does nothing president bush will have won
there still are some details to be nailed down mr bush is reserving the right in rare instances to keep congress in the dark	a constitutional prerogative the committee does nt recognize and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled
he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending but some analysts particularly conservative legal scholars have urged mr bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to	that the constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a lineitem veto such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power

the government s startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against ge in philadelphia federal district court challenge the motives and veracity of the nation s thirdlargest defense contractor in a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday ge	that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts the company attacked the government s allegations as reckless and baseless mudslinging and said its management promptly and accurately reported to the pentagon all relevant information about billing practices
when ge finally disclosed the problems prosecutors contend that mr orr was erroneously informed that the lcb suspected rcb practices had only just been discovered by ge management in its brief the government	that it needs the internal ge documents to rebut anticipated efforts by ge during the trial to demonstrate its good corporate character ge which was surprised by the lastminute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents countered that senior ge managers did nt find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 and that the information was passed on quickly to mr orr at his first meeting with company representatives
ge s filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity the company s conduct does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent ratification or coverup ge s brief	on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters

i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it	she haunted me she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs salter to return to the country

naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she could nt leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her host and it so	that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds between the toes
the policeman walked on but he looked back once that had	on the day when two other unusual things had occurred arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area and they had told their mother about the tumbles

the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them asking for a piece of lemonmeringue pie gets a plate of english muffins instead leaving the theatre after the performance i had a flash of intuition that life after all lrb as rilke said rrb is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to	to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middleaged steam shovel

billgoodman i think it s a very slippery slope billgoodman i once i think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you re going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you re basically that i under certain circumstances it can	billgoodman it should happen and then it s going happen under more than those exceptional circumstances billgoodman it s going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual

larryking did you ever think you would harm them larryking that	sometimes lindahamilton um no i have not ever felt that
lindahamilton but i know people that have lindahamilton and i praise god that that did nt	to me larryking did you have hallucinations too
lindahamilton well um i was a challenge lindahamilton i think jim said to me once i like who i leave in the morning but i do nt always know who i m going to come home to at night because depending on what had	during the day if something had distressed me a small thing had become a huge thing and i could nt let it go and i could nt forgive and i could nt get out of myself and i just could nt let go larryking he directed you did he not
lindahamilton the rage larryking yeah what	when you had a rage lindahamilton i would throw jim s stuff out of the house
lindahamilton um and i just would nt give in lindahamilton if he would nt apologize i could nt go to any other place except i wish this had nt	lindahamilton and that s no way to live a life
lindahamilton it must be exhausting for anybody around to not know who you re going to be next larryking in a minute we ll ask linda what	to bring it to a head how she turned a corner larryking linda hamilton
larryking did you get so low that larryking what	that you got wellness lindahamilton i lost two marriages

senatorschumer and the only time you really get to question them see what they think is when the senate has its confirmation process senatorschumer we agree that that ought to	senatorschumer it ought to happen in a dignified way
senatorschumer we agree that that ought to	senatorschumer it ought to happen in a dignified way senatorschumer it ought to happen in thoughtful way
senatorschumer it ought to	in a dignified way senatorschumer it ought to happen in thoughtful way senatorschumer but it certainly ought to happen
senatorschumer it ought to	in thoughtful way senatorschumer but it certainly ought to happen larryking he wo nt make the court if approved until january right
senatorschumer i would have hoped that the president would choose a real consensus nominee who would have much broader support senatorschumer but i think what	here is not a single senator for instance said that uh harriet myers nomination should be withdrawn senatorschumer sam may have been on the edge
senatorschumer and you know i got to tell you this larry senatorschumer i ca nt tell you what will	with judge alito senatorschumer i think it s very close as david gergen said
mikewallace that s that s uh that s what started the depression for the first time mikewallace i did nt realize what was	mikewallace but to sit in a cold and drafty federal court room being called thief liar cheat etc by the
mikewallace ok so we did the piece anyway mikewallace uh what	then was when he came to the white house i figured well come on mikewallace the time has come
mikewallace the the uh we used to bicker on the air mikewallace and what	was after a while the bickering continued after we got off the air larryking after you got off the air
generalabizaid that s to drive us out before the iraqis are ready to assume the battle space generalabizaid if that s what	they could win generalabizaid but but it s very very clear to me that we re going to stay the course that we re going to build iraqi security capacity that the iraqi are serious about being partners in this effort and they re very serious about taking over the effort
generalabizaid but ultimately we did generalabizaid and that s what s going to	with the iraqi armed forces as well generalabizaid they need time
generalabizaid it brings foreign fighters in from saudi arabia and north africa generalabizaid it is connected to what is	in afghanistan and what is happening in pakistan generalabizaid it is a global battle that we face
generalabizaid it brings foreign fighters in from saudi arabia and north africa generalabizaid it is connected to what is	in afghanistan and what is happening in pakistan generalabizaid it is a global battle that we face
generalabizaid uh but it s not the only battle wolfblitzer is it time to reconsider women american women in combat in the aftermath of what	this past week wolfblitzer more american women died in combat were injured i believe in any time since world war two
wolfblitzer that s a disturbing element i assume for you as far as the demoralization of the us military generalabizaid that the only thing i can tell you wolf is when i go to the field the soldiers are uniformly confident about their ability to face this enemy make iraq afghanistan whatever area they	to be operating in better defeat the terrorist wherever they find them and they all understand it s going to take time generalabizaid it it it s not a sprint
carllevin but i do nt think so carllevin i think that the problem here that we ve had right from the beginning is overly optimistic predictions on the part of what would	if we attacked iraq carllevin and it s these policies which need to be changed
presidentemilelahoud for sure it s not lebanon nor syria presidentemilelahoud because until the assassination everything was fine the stability and security were at its best according to interpol who are number one on the list of security in the world presidentemilelahoud and what	made us uh go back because we lost a lot by it and i m sure that nobody harms himself presidentemilelahoud so it could nt be syria nor lebanon
presidentemilelahoud we said because they were trying to unstable lebanon presidentemilelahoud and eh another thing	only a few months before the assassination of president presidentemilelahoud and that was when uh eh uh they tried to put a bomb in the uh italian embassy
jonkyl if we have a profile of some kind of killer in this society and frankly there s a rapist on the loose in arizona right now and there is a a picture that s been drawn of by by police uh artists of what this guy looks like jonkyl and anybody that has an appearance somewhat like him should expect to be profiled by the police here jonkyl by the way he	to be a young white male apparently jonkyl but whatever the appearance of a potential terrorist is is fair game for profiling
waynehale that is the problem that we have to solve for the next flight waynehale for this flight we are we understand what	in terms of damage to the orbiter waynehale and we believe it will be safe to reenter
waynehale we have provisions to bring back the entire seven person crew of discovery if required in an emergency situation waynehale we certainly do nt think that s going to	at this point waynehale but we re holding that preparation um in readiness in case something changes
waynehale we ve built the recumbant seats waynehale um and the other emergency provisions to bring back that larger crew on a single rescue flight if required wolfblitzer how did this miscalculation	waynehale you know we looked very hard at the foam on the pal ramp before flight
wolfblitzer but a quick question wolfblitzer when do you believe if it	the next shuttle will take off waynehale well we are we are putting together a team that will go off and do an investigation uh and come up with the solution on this problem
bobwoodward sure a little bit bobwoodward but you know what what	ah bobwoodward there were so many specifics in our stories ah about money and and high level people in the white house and the nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did
bobwoodward i ve got other things to do bobwoodward ah i know what	bobwoodward he kn he knows ah what happened
bobwoodward ah i know what	bobwoodward he kn he knows ah what happened bobwoodward i what s the loop to close
bobwoodward who knows ah bobwoodward funny things	bobwoodward but i think ah felt s lawyer and family can do ah something that s going to add to the record on all of this
howardkurtz but that her former boss says no way howardkurtz that never	howardkurtz and the times was so conflicted in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about libby and pulled their punches in other ways
howardkurtz arianna huffington the times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that judy miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own wmd reporting was wrong howardkurtz and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on valerie plame two years ago jill abrahamson now the paper s managing editor says no way howardkurtz that did nt	howardkurtz in other words there s a dispute in the accounts
ariannahuffington and the similarities for the jayson blair case ariannahuffington remember after the jayson blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what	ariannahuffington especially about why is a major institution like the times ignoring so many red flags howardkurtz alright
ariannahuffington the truth is that it s very clear from the stories today that she could ve asked uh scooter libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier ariannahuffington all of that could have happened ariannahuffington it did not	because clearly judy miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the american public
ariannahuffington all of that could have happened ariannahuffington it did not	because clearly judy miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the american public ariannahuffington and the new york times is
franksesno you re going to walk through it franksesno so that it	does nt surprise me franksesno that it hurts the president yeah that s inevitable too
howardkurtz jay carson is the spokesman for former president bill clinton lannydavis jay carson is the spokesperson for president clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the khobar towers which	to be not true lannydavis president clinton at that re uh meeting did press the uh crown prince to cooperate with the fbi
tomfriedman but there s only one way we win this war howie is it takes a village tomfriedman it only	when the sunni muslim world basically turns people in tomfriedman and when the sunni muslim world restrains their own tomfriedman and what was so shocking to me about this story a sunni jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of ramadan
tomfriedman and there s so much fatigue that we do nt sit back and say wait a minute tomfriedman what	today tomfriedman a sunni muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of ramadan their holiest day
tomfriedman but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there tomfriedman if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there tomfriedman um if it if it does nt	i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure
tomfriedman if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there tomfriedman um if it if it does nt	i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure tomfriedman so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the american people
howardkurtz that s a uh that s a harsh uh assessment tomfriedman i would say that there was a lot of ignoring there s several things	basically in the last three years tomfriedman i would call it a poli a perfect storm
xiaojianghe people all got up xiaojianghe did something	xiaojianghe some folks got up
xuli goodbye wangshilin news and events	every day wangshilin what you are interested in is exactly what our focuses are

wangshilin and equally without doubt blair did not want him that is bush to do this wangshilin well it	er that our correspondent did an interview at the aljazeera s beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now which was broadcast live by aljazeera tv station wangshilin it was the news about bush s plan to bomb aljazeera tv station
wuhuixuan for instance the us attacked aljazeera tv station several times wuhuixuan it	once that when bush er together with that defense secretary rumsfeld visited qatar they put pressure put pressure on the qatari government saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the us wangshilin uhhuh
speaker1 while the us military searched everywhere for information on bin laden in vain aljazeera tv station frequently aired the footage of bin laden making a speech wangshilin mr wu we know that you	to be in qatar when aljazeera tv station was just established in 1996 wuhuixuan right
wangshilin yeah ruanzongze in addition it also looks at major events as they	from the unique perspective of the arab region or arab world wangshilin uhhuh
wuhuixuan yes wangshilin favorable geographical conditions that is to say it	to be located geographically in the arab world wuhuixuan yeah
wangshilin welcome to focus today wangshilin today let s turn our attention to a road cavein accident that	in beijing over the holiday wangshilin before dawn on january 3 a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of jingguang bridge east third ring road beijing municipality resulting in the road caving in
wangshilin well i especially want to know ha how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident zhouhanhua ah at 1100 am about 1100 m yesterday ah i	to find out through an sms when i was outside wangshilin uhhuh
wangshilin uhhuh zhouhanhua it	that i was going to have lunch with a friend um at noon zhouhanhua and then the friend first sent me an sms wangshilin uhhuh zhouhanhua saying he would come pick me up to go together
wangshilin and you yang yang yangyang a friend	to call me wangshilin you were not at work that day
yangyang no yangyang the station called me at noon and said something	at jingguang bridge and that i had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program wangshilin uhhuh that means er you found out the accident through an information source at the station
wangshilin we drive often in beijing ha yang yang wangshilin if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there what do you think would	if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear yangyang yes
yangyang well i think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes wangshilin if the accident did not	perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many yangyang it is really like this just look at the bus signs

alexthier and many of those same people are back in power alexthier and afghanistan really represents something that s	in the broader islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and islamic values on the other hand danabrams i mean because the afghan constitution ar article two point two says followers of other religions are free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law
danabrams well let me ask you about danabrams i mean since you were involved in helping them create their constitution and their law wh when you were helping them do that did you foresee something like this maybe	alexthier we absolutely did
alexthier you re right dan alexthier it s a travesty um that something like this could	anywhere in the world alexthier and i think that it really contains a very important lesson for us in that we really need to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like this
danabrams i mean is the president going to be able to work on this diplomatically as he says and with the people that they have contacts with and resolve this danabrams i mean it sounds like what s going to	is the government s going to declare this guy mentally ill alexthier well i think that the government is is really looking for a way out of this

chrismatthews uh i do nt think so normcoleman it s not going to	normcoleman and the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say the un has not been as effective as it should be
normcoleman that s why the president is going to be speaking there normcoleman and he has got a guy by his side who can help make that	chrismatthews so i should nt have quoted him

chrismatthews we re back with radio talk show host melanie morgan and iraq war veteren paul rieckhoff chrismatthews melanie how do we get the straight scoop on what s	in iraq because people tell me there s only two ways to go over there as a journalist i think your experience confirms this you either go over there and stay in the green zone or that that part of uh uh which is very secure and it s basically a compound or you go out with a unit as an embedded uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter chrismatthews you never really get to mix with the locals
paulrieckhoff there s a likelihood that i ll go back while ms morgan is back at her radio show paulrieckhoff so what i really want to do is educate the public about the truth of what s	there paulrieckhoff and i think the reality is that when people like her go over there there s a public affairs officer standing right next to that young soldier

public relations strategists everywhere watching the reaction of the german press the	press the lunaticfringe press listening to their neighbors studying interviews with men and women on the street cried out too much too much the mind of the audience is becoming dulled the horrors are losing their effect and still another witness one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant s department of jewish affairs
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution s case it might be contended of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying antisemitic feelings was	or insisting on a private definition of antisemitism but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment
what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against antisemitism than this opportunity to expose the exact	between the respectable antisemite and the concentrationcamp brute not in eichmann s antisemitism but in the antisemitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their antisemitism as an innocent dislike of jews as do others like them today

it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american	is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine after all the average american as he lies and waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen s comprehension and control anyone s identification with an international struggle whether warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement

the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the president s decision will finally clarify itself as a moral rather than a medical problem because the responsibility for resolving the issue	with the president rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure for the president had dealt with the matter humbly in what he conceived as the democratic way
